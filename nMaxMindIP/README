GeoIP C# API 2.0
================

A C# Library for accessing the MaxMindIP database. Forked from the "official" code to change it to use .NET coding standards and
to add tests and improve where possible.

To run the tests get the latest database for the appropiate tests and place it in the test project directory 
and mark it as content - always copy

This code is used in the Adzerk Ad Delivery Platform (http://adzerk.com) and is well tested and performs at high scale.

MEMORY CACHING

There are two options available:

GEOIP_STANDARD - read database from filesystem, uses least memory.

GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE - load database into memory, faster performance
        but uses more memory
